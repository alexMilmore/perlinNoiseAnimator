# perlinNoiseAnimator
Creates a 2D array of perlin noise corresponding to each pixel in a window and chooses colour based on the value. Creates a shifting landscape of colour. Currently runs very slow as it is not parallelised. Would be improved by using CUDA to perform some of the work on the GPU.
